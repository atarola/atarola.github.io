Wherein I'll describe my plans for my upcoming sabbatical.

## What

Jonathan Coulton once did a new song each week for a year and released them all as a podcast.  Some of the songs were good, some not so much, but I've always respected the idea of creating for creating's sake.

There have been a huge number of personal projects I've always wanted to do "someday". Recently, the fates have afforded me the opportunity to take some time to do what I want to do.

So, before job hunting, I'm gonna take some time to do all of those "someday" projects.  

Each of the projects will get at least one week of effort. At the end of each week, I'll write up a blog post about what I was able to do and how it turned out.

## Ideas (so far)

Here are some ideas of things I may do:

- Reminder IOS App
- Diplomacy Slack Bot
- Browser-based Dungeon Map App

## First Week

For my first project, I'm going to do a "Delicious-like" Social Bookmarking Site.  Think pintrest for old people.  A logged in user should be able to save and tag links via a bookmarklet, with a nice UI to then sort and search saved links.
