## What I do

I build Web Applications and ReSTful APIs.  I am interested in UX development and distributed applications.  I love to mentor junior developers and help them grow their careers.

## I’m really good at

On the back-end, I have written written ReSTful APIs in Python, Node.js, or Ruby.  I am equally comfortable using frameworks like flask, express, or sinatra.  I prefer using NoSQL datastores like MongoDB or Redis, but have used MySQL and postgres in the past.  

For the front-end, I've made both normal websites and single-page applications.  I love working on UIs in Javascript.  I have done apps in Backbone.js with JQuery and, more recently, with React.js and Redux.

I have used the cloud extensively, both with IaaS and PaaS solutions.  Currently I'm really digging Docker and have been enjoying the simplicity that using containers brings to deployment.

I also love mentoring junior developers.  There is no cooler feeling than seeing someone you helped do awesome things.

## Technologies I've Used

Python, HTML 5, Node.js, SQL, SqlAlchemy, Flask, React, Redux,  Git, Docker, Gulp, virtualenv, Cloud Computing, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache, Nginx, Redis, and MongoDB
